# Dice-Roller
A dice roller is a simple tool designed to simulate the rolling of dice, commonly used in various games, board games, role-playing games (RPGs), and recreational activities. The idea is to provide a digital or physical representation of the random outcomes that occur when rolling dice, allowing users to generate numbers within a specified range.
